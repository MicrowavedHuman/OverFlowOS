# OverFlowOS: A Simple Explanation
Whilst this is a lofty goal, this is the first of my many steps into creating the OverFlow suite of products. Now this is a project I've had in mind for awhile my own Operating System. A neat idea
but for a while I saw it as nothing more than an idea, now I have the capabilitity and skills to actually do it. Currently it's very very bare bones: but it's structured properly and should work.
Since this project is Open Source, feel free to fork it and add what you want. Right now it's development will currently be paused as I work on the creation of OverFlow, the programming language which
I intend to use to create the Operating System. Which means upon finishing OverFlow, this will once more be majorly refactored.

# The OverFlow Suite: Goals
This is a major goal of mine, I've wanted to do something like this for a while. Currently the projects that will belong to the OverFlow suite are:
* OverFlowOS: A free open source Operating System, with the goals of being truly original. No third party software, currently it hasn't reached the no third party software goal.
* OverFlow: The programming language that I intend to use for the rest of these projects, it will be made as sort of the core of all the OverFlow Suite products. Currently this project is my main focus.
* OverBoot: A bootloader to be used in combination with OverFlowOS, following similar ideas to OverFlowOS, with the idea of no third party software. Currently unstarted.
* OverCompile: A collection of compilers, meant to compile C, C++, Overflow, and maybe some other languages to if I want to expand.
